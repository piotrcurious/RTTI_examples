I used the RTTI library that I found on GitHub: https://github.com/RobTillaart/RTTI. It is a library that provides run-time type information and serialization for Arduino. It has no additional dependencies, but it requires C++11 support. You can install it using the Arduino Library Manager or by downloading the ZIP file and importing it manually.
